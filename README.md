## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_random.asp

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
   While submitting my project, I struggled most with task 2. I struggled with understanding what to upload from my desktop after watching the 10 minute video. The 10 minute video was very confusing because I did not code an additional documents that had to be uploaded from m computer. I reached out to the instructors on Slack, but they were unable to give me good feedback. As a result, I tried to figure it out by working on the next steps and then coming back to the 10 minute video. Although, it was repetitive and took up a lot of time, I was able to put it all together and I believe I submitted my work correctly. 


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
In regards to web development I would like to know more about coding in javascript. From what I have seen,  the code itself seem pretty similar to coding in Java, but the essence of the code is different. I want to know what the similarities and differences between the two are. How much coding is necessary when web developing and how can I improve my skills as a web developer?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few more hours to work on m project, I would add a timer, add images to the buttons and make the audio sound more like the beats you would hear in a studio.
